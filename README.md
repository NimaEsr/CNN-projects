# CNN-projects

In this repository, we experiment with real-worl interesting applications of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs):

1 - Car detection in autonomous driving systems

2 - Face recognition for identification and access authority

3 - Image segmentation used for self-driving vehicles

4 - Transfer learning with MobileNet

5 - Neural style transfer
